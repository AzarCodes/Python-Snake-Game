# Snake Game in Python

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python and the `pygame` library. The goal of the game is to guide the snake to eat food that appears randomly on the screen. Each time the snake eats food, it grows in size. The game ends if the snake runs into the wall or its own body.

## Features
- **Classic Snake gameplay**: Move the snake around the screen to eat food and grow in size.
- **Game Over**: The game ends when the snake hits the wall or collides with itself.
- **Restart Option**: After a game over, the user can press `C` to play again or `Q` to quit.
- **Score Display**: The score increases as the snake eats food, and it is displayed at the top of the screen.
